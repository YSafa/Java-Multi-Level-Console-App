## ✨ Features

### [A] Primary School
- **Age & Zodiac Sign Detection** — Enter your date of birth and get your exact age (years, months, days) and zodiac sign, calculated without built-in date/time libraries.
- **Reverse the Words** — Reverses every word (2+ letters) in a given text, including Turkish characters, while leaving punctuation and digits untouched. Implemented recursively.

### [B] Secondary School
- **Prime Numbers** — Input an integer n ≥ 12 and generate all primes up to n using three different sieve algorithms: Sieve of Eratosthenes, Sieve of Sundaram, and Sieve of Atkin. Execution times are compared side by side.
- **Step-by-Step Expression Evaluator** — Enter a mathematical expression using digits and (+, −, ×, :, (, )) operators. The app evaluates it step by step, following operator precedence, and prints each stage recursively until the final result.

### [C] High School
- **Statistical Analysis of an Array** — Calculates the median, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean (computed recursively) for a user-defined array of doubles.
- **Distance Between Two Arrays** — Computes Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance, and Cosine Similarity between two integer arrays.

### [D] University
- **Connect Four** — A fully playable Connect Four game with animated disc drops, selectable board sizes (5×4, 6×5, 7×6), and two modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. Computer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (single `.java` file, multiple methods)
- **I/O:** Console-based with ANSI color codes for a colorful UI
- **Documentation:** JavaDoc

## ▶️ How to Run

**Requirements:** Java JDK 8 or higher

```bash
# Compile
javac Group29.java

# Run
java Group29
```

> **Note:** ANSI color codes require a terminal that supports them (e.g., Linux/macOS Terminal, Windows Terminal). Colors may not display correctly in some basic Windows CMD environments.
